The remote IO-control module in return will respond with a confirmation event code using websocket.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving the confirmation code, the web control interface will show an ON/OFF message to each corresponding device HTML section. \r\n\r\nThe button color will also change not only indicating an ON or OFF state condition but also as confirmation it has established successful connection with the IO-control module.      \r\n\r\nMake sure all dependencies are installed before running the application.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nTo install all dependencies, use the following CLI command inside the app root folder.\r\n\r\n~~~bash\r\n$ npm install\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\nor\r\n~~~bash\r\n$ npm install express body-parser socket.io --save\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\n\r\nTo start the application, use the following CLI command inside the app root folder.   \r\n~~~bash\r\n$ node app\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\nand type the following in your development PC browser address bar. \r\n~~~~\r\nhttp://localhost:3000 \r\n~~~~\r\n\r\nEnsure the IO-control module is also running as a separate process.\r\n\r\n### Using your Mobile Device\r\nTo test it from your mobile device/other PC, open a port from your development PC where the app is running. \r\nGet the local ip (IPv4 address) using ipconfig in Windows. Use the ip instead of localhost in your mobile device/other PC as shown below.\r\n~~~~\r\nhttp://192.168.1.169:3000 \r\n~~~~\r\nNote: Your ip will be different from the example above.\r\nYour development PC and your mobile device/other PC must be connected to the same SSID of your WiFi network.  \r\n\r\n### License\r\nMIT ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
